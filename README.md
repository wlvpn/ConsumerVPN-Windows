# ConsumerVPN

ConsumerVPN is an application that WLVPN clients can use as a base for their own customer-facing application, the minimum required effort is adding your WLVPN credentials and changing the colors to fit your brand. It also serves as a real world implementation of VpnSDK and can be used as a reference for your own original application.
